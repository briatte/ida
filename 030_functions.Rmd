# 3. Functions

We saw a bit of calculus, logic and vector/matrix manipulation last week. This week, we thread on the same topics with slightly more advanced operators. Here, for instance, is the modulus operator in R:

```{r modulus}
4 %/% 3
6 %/% 3
```

Many matrix operators are also available: you might want to go back to the [cheat sheet](https://gastonsanchez.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/cheat-sheet-of-matrix-operations-in-r/) previously mentioned. Here are some basic manipulations on matrixes built out of random integers.

```{r matrix-ops}
# Create a random 3 x 5 matrix.
A <- matrix(as.integer(10*runif(30)), nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
# Check result.
A
# Create a random 2 x 2 (square) matrix.
B <- matrix(as.integer(10*runif(16)), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
# Check result.
B
# Create another one.
C <- matrix(as.integer(10*runif(16)), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
# Check result.
C
# Now a basic manipulation: scalar multiplication.
2*A
# Another one: extract the diagonal.
diag(B)
# Last one: matrix transposition.
t(C)
```

As an exercise, explain the result of a square matrix product.

```{r matrix-product}
# Square matrix multiplication.
B %*% C
```

## Functional programming

Suppose that you find yourself doing the same computation over and over again. You do not want to type the whole calculations every time you need: you want to program a function that does the job for you.

Take a basic example: the `sum` command adds a vector of numbers together.

```{r sum}
# Create a vector of 99 random [0,1] values.
x <- runif(9)
# Check result: show first 5 values.
head(x)
# Add them up.
sum(x)
```

Re-defining that function under a different name is trivial, except the example below will only accept two elements to show their sum, as defined by the primitive function `+`. The example is trivial insofar as functions are generally designed to capture more complex operations.

```{r add-function}
# Define function.
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
# Example.
add(2, 4)
```

Statistical computing courses like [the one taught by Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/) contains tons of interesting examples of such functions. A simple function from that course is shown below to illustrate the principle of recursion in computer code:

```{r crs-factorial}
# Calculate a factorial
# Input: a number (n)
# Output: the factorial of n
# Presumes: n is a single positive integer
my.factorial <- function(n) {
  if (n == 1) {  # Base case
    return(1)
  } else {  # Recursion
    return(n*my.factorial(n-1))
  }
}
```

## Plotting functions

This course might lead you to write simple functions, but for the moment, let's focus simply on plotting them with the `ggplot2` package, which makes it fairly easy. The example below shows the basic function $y = x$.

```{r fun-identity}
qplot(c(0,2), stat="function", fun = identity, geom = "point")
```

Here's a function that will be more useful to us: the exponential.

```{r fun-exp}
qplot(-10:10, stat="function", fun = exp, geom = c("line", "point"))
```

And finally an example of several embedded functions: the plot first generates a random distribution of $N = 1000$ observations and then draws its empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), to which we will come back in due time.

```{r fun-ecdf}
qplot(rnorm(1000), stat = "ecdf", geom = "step")
```

Some common functions: 

  max(x);
  
  min(x);
  
  range(x);
  
  sum(x);
  
  cumsum(x);
  
  mean(x);
  
  median(x);
  
  mode(x);
  
  mode(z);
  
  var(x); # divisor is n-1 and not n
  
  sd(x);
  
  sort(x); #increasing order of magnitude
  
  diff(x); # (range of data can be found as diff(range(x))
  
  summary(x); # six number summary based on the quantiles.
  
  quantile (x, k); # kth percentile
  
  fivenum(x); # five number summary based on quartiles
  
  cov(x,y); # covariance
  
  cor(x,y); #correlation
