# README

The `data` folder hosts the course datasets. It misses little things scraped from Wikipedia that are not saved, and additional class exercises like the Rheinart and Rogoff replication.

The data are downloaded and immediately saved to comma-separated values (`.csv`), unless specified as `.zip` (zipped subfolder) or `.tsv` (tab-separated values). Some files (marked `•`) required preprocessing or authentification to download, and are self-contained to the course.
